# Code Quality - Code Structure with Stereotypes
This repository contains three different microservices that host a single endpoint. Each endpoint is exactly the same - however the code is structured slightly differently

 - Single File - BAD code structure representing what a "make it work" looks like in extreme programming. Bair minimum effort to allow the server to perform the job
 - Sock Drawers - BAD code structure representing code organized by sock drawers - where the file type dictates the folder structure
 - Functionality - GOOD code structure representing code organized by function or purpose. Code can be hierarchical and can provide growth

## Sample Requests
 - curl 'http://localhost:3000/?type=starships&num=9'
 - curl 'http://localhost:3000/?type=people&num=1'
